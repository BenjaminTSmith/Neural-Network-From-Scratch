# Neural Network from Scratch
## Build
To configure cmake for this project, run
```bash
./configure.sh
```
After you have configured cmake, run
```bash
./build.sh
```
This will
create an executable binary for your system in the build directory,
which you can then run. Alternatively you can run
```bash
make
```
inside of the build directory, or
```bash
cmake --build .
```
(Make sure you have cmake and make installed).
