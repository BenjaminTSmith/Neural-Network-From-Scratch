# Neural Network from Scratch
## Build
To configure the native cmake build system for this project, run
```bash
bash configure.sh
```
After you have configured cmake, run
```bash
bash build.sh
```
This will
create an executable binary for your system in the build directory,
which you can then run.
(Make sure you have cmake and make installed).
